# AdSmart: Campaign Performance Analytics 

Welcome to **AdSmart**, where we turn *fake ad campaigns* into *real data science flexes*.

This project is my way of saying: “Hey, I may not have 10 years of experience — but I *do* know how to simulate a campaign, slice some data, test a hypothesis, and wrangle a stubborn regression model into telling me something useful.”

Inspired by companies(and honestly, any team doing cool work at the intersection of **ads, machine learning, and analytics**), AdSmart shows how I think, experiment, and tell stories with data.

## Project Goal

To simulate and analyze digital ad campaign performance using first-party user data, develop metrics that actually mean something, and apply statistical + ML tools to figure out what’s working, what’s tanking, and what to do about it.

Think of this as a mock performance marketing lab — minus the drama of a real budget and the pressure of a quarterly review.

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- **SQL-style querying** (Pandas for now — SQLite if I get fancy)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (where all the action happens)
- **Streamlit or Dash** (optional dashboard, still deciding if it vibes)
- **GitHub** (obviously)

## 📊 Key Metrics Tracked

| Metric | What It Tells Us |
|--------|------------------|
| CTR    | Are people even noticing this thing? |
| CVR    | Are they doing what we hoped after clicking? |
| ROAS   | Are we getting our money’s worth? |
| CAC    | How much did it cost to get one loyal human? |

These are the kinds of questions that keep campaign managers up at night. Fortunately, I recently realized I enjoy figuring them out.

## Experiments & Analysis

- Synthetic user & campaign data generation
- Custom KPI framework for performance insights
- A/B testing simulations with real statistical rigor
- Regression modeling to find performance drivers
- Bonus ML model to predict click-through potential

## Why This Exists

Because learning by building is my favorite form of rebellion.  
Because analytics is more than just numbers — it’s storytelling with evidence.  
And because I want to show what I can do before I’m handed a title that says I already can.

> No budgets were harmed in the making of this project. All data is simulated. But the insights? 100% real.
